# Running the proxy

Hack your way around, good luck

# TODO

Reconnects - reconsile with all existing breakpoints in the runtime
F5 - recognize it and reset debuger state
release object groups - we don't send for the groups we create nor do we intercept the fake ones we generate for the runtime
Deal with the browser caching stuff across execution - cache invalidation and proper bundling of resources
Figure out how to enable/disable debugging
Do some target validation - right now we simply assume the debugee has a mono runtime in debug mode
